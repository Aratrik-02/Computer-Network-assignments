1.a) Take a decimal number from user. Convert it to different 
bases (e.g.: 2,8,16 etc.) and send those values to message 
queue. Write three separate programs to read and display the 
binary, octal and hex value from the message queue 
distinctively.

b) Create a message queue. One process will take name and 
roll number of 'N' students and send those to message 
queue. Second process will read the names, sort those and 
send back to message queue; third process will do the same 
on roll numbers. Then first process will read the entire data 
and print.

2) Write C Programs to implement a simple client-server application 
using Unix File socket. The client will take a bit-stream from the 
user and send it to server. The server will add a parity bit to it and 
send the modified bit-stream to the corresponding client. The 
client will print the result.

4)Write C Programs to implement a simple client-server 
application. The client will take a data word and divisor from 
the user and send them to server. The server will find out the 
codeword using CRC and return it back to the client. Use Unix 
File socket for communication.

5.Write C programs to implement TCP Socket. The client will take 
a bit-stream from the user and send it to the server. The server 
will implement bit stuffing and send the stream back to the client. 
The client will print it.

6.Create a multi-client TCP server. A client will send an IPv4 
address (a.b.c.d) to the server. The server will verify whether 
the address is valid or not and send back 'YES' or 'NO' as a 
result to the client.

7.1
Write client-server programs using UDP socket. The client will 
take a data word from the user and send it to the server. The server 
will find the codeword (use Hamming code error correction 
technique) and send it back to the client.

7.2
Write C programs to implement a simple chat server (single client, 
single server) by using UDP Socket. 

8.1
Write C programs to implement group chat using multicast 
UDP socket

8.2
Write two programs one for the sender and another for the 
receiver, where the sender will broadcast a message taken as 
user input and all the receivers (at least three) will print the 
received message. This will continue forever until the user 
enters "QUIT" at the sender

9. Simulate Data Link Layer flow control mechanism (Stop & 
Wait ARQ) using TCP Socket.
